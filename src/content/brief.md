# AutomationWise – Project Support & Technical Troubleshooting

**Based in Louisiana – Available Remote & On-Site**

I’m a seasoned systems administrator and software generalist with 20+ years’ experience in:

- **Systems & Infrastructure** – Linux, Windows, network configuration, environment setup, migrations  
- **Automation & Scripting** – Python, Bash/Zsh, PowerShell, Ansible, CI/CD pipelines  
- **Troubleshooting & Recovery** – Debugging stubborn issues, stabilizing broken systems, rescuing failed deployments  
- **Integration Work** – APIs, cloud services, cross-platform workflows  
- **Documentation & Process** – Clean, repeatable setups; Git-based knowledge management

**How I Work**  
- You own the project — I make the problems go away.  
- Clear scope, fair rate, no micromanagement needed.  
- Subcontractor or embedded temporary engineer.  
- Short bursts or longer engagements.

**When to Call Me**  
- Stalled migration or deployment  
- Half-built automation that needs to run yesterday  
- Persistent issue that needs sharp eyes  
- Team is swamped, need trusted extra hands
